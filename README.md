## 1. Project Overview

Server rooms are the nerve center of any organization, yet they are vulnerable to two major threats: **unauthorized physical access** and **environmental failures** like overheating. This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end IoT system designed to provide intelligent, active monitoring and control for such a critical environment.

The system combines a physical sensor-and-actuator node with a powerful backend gateway and a web-based user interface. It actively manages room temperature with a variable-speed fan, physically secures the door with a solenoid lock, and provides instant security alerts with photographic evidence upon a potential breach.

## 2. Key Features

-   **Real-Time Security Alerts:** Instant notification with photographic evidence when the door is opened without authorization.
-   **Audible & Visual Alarms:** A loud buzzer and flashing LED provide immediate on-site alerts during a security breach.
-   **Remote Door Control:** The door can be unlocked remotely via the web dashboard using a secure command flow.
-   **Automated Climate Control:** A variable-speed fan automatically adjusts its speed to maintain a stable room temperature, preventing hardware damage.
-   **Interactive Web Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit, the UI provides live data gauges, historical charts, a security event log with images, and system controls.
-   **Maintenance Mode:** A software toggle to allow for authorized physical access without triggering security alarms.

## 3. System Architecture

The system utilizes a robust, distributed architecture that separates on-site tasks from backend processing. This design enhances reliability, security, and scalability.

-   **NodeMCU ESP32:** Acts as the dedicated "field device." Its sole responsibilities are to read local sensors, control local actuators, and communicate efficiently with the gateway.
-   **Raspberry Pi 5:** Serves as the central "gateway" and application server. It handles all heavy processing, secure communication with cloud services, hosts the user-facing web application, and manages the USB webcam.

## 5. Logical Flows

### a. Climate Control Flow (Continuous Local Loop)

This logic runs autonomously on the **NodeMCU ESP32**.

```graphviz
digraph Climate_Control_Flow {
    graph [label="Climate Control Logic (on ESP32)", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=box, style=rounded];
    
    Start [shape=ellipse, label="Loop Start"];
    ReadTemp [label="Read Temperature\nfrom DHT22"];
    MapSpeed [label="Map Temperature Range\n(e.g., 20-40Â°C)\nto Fan Speed Range\n(e.g., 40-100%)"];
    SetSpeed [label="Set Fan Speed\nvia PWM to L298N Driver"];
    Wait [shape=ellipse, label="Wait 5 seconds"];
    
    Start -> ReadTemp -> MapSpeed -> SetSpeed -> Wait -> Start;
}
```

### b. Unauthorized Access Alert Flow (System-Wide Sequence)

This sequence shows the interaction between all system components during a security breach.

```graphviz
digraph Alert_Sequence {
    graph [label="Unauthorized Access Logic Flow", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=box, style=rounded, fontname="Arial"];
    edge [fontsize=10];
    
    {rank=same; ESP32; RPi_Gateway; Firebase;}

    ESP32 -> RPi_Gateway [label="1. Door Opens.\nESP32 sends 'door_open' event (MQTT)."];
    RPi_Gateway -> Firebase [label="2. Pi receives event.\nChecks 'Maintenance Mode'\nin DB. It is OFF."];
    RPi_Gateway -> RPi_Gateway [label="3. Pi triggers C270 Webcam\nto capture an image."];

| **`Input (sensors)`** | **Met.** Two primary sensors are used: a Magnetic Reed Switch (for door status) and a DHT22 (for temperature/humidity). |
| **`Output (actuator / indicator)`** | **Met & Exceeded.** Seven output components are used: a Solenoid Lock, a DC Fan (via L298N Driver), a Piezo Buzzer, a Green LED, a Red LED, and the USB Webcam (as an output triggered by logic). **Total components: 9.** |
| **`Processing` & `Business Rules Design`** | **Met.** The Raspberry Pi gateway contains extensive processing logic: checking "Maintenance Mode" status, correlating door events with camera triggers, and sending commands back to the ESP32 based on defined security rules. |
| **`Database / Cloud` Feature** | **Met.** Google Firebase is used for both a Realtime Database (event logs, system status) and Cloud Storage (for images), demonstrating professional cloud architecture. |
| **`User Interface` Module** | **Met.** A rich, interactive web application is built with Streamlit, providing not just reports but also two-way control (remote unlock, maintenance mode toggle). |
| **`Analysis Report` based on Collected Data** | **Met.** The Streamlit dashboard generates a historical temperature chart (time-series analysis) and presents a real-time security event log with photographic evidence (event reports). |
| **`On-The-Spot Evaluation`** | **Ready.** System parameters like temperature thresholds and alert logic are all managed in the Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi, making them easy to modify live during the final presentation. |
