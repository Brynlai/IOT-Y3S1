# Smart Server Room Monitor

A comprehensive IoT system for monitoring and controlling the security and climate of a critical server room. This project provides real-time alerts, remote control capabilities, and historical data analysis through a modern web interface.

## Overview

Server rooms are the nerve center of any organization, but they are vulnerable to two major threats: unauthorized physical access and environmental failures (overheating). This project solves both problems by creating an intelligent, closed-loop monitoring system. It detects door entries, provides photographic evidence of access, automatically manages room temperature with a variable-speed fan, and allows for remote control and monitoring through a custom Streamlit web application.

## Features

-   **Real-Time Security Alerts:** Instant notification with photographic evidence when a door is opened.
-   **Audible & Visual Alarms:** A loud buzzer and flashing LED provide immediate on-site alerts during a security breach.
-   **Remote Door Control:** A solenoid lock can be unlocked remotely via the web dashboard.
-   **Automated Climate Control:** A variable-speed fan automatically adjusts to maintain the target temperature.
-   **Interactive Web Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit, the UI provides live data, historical charts, and system controls.
-   **Maintenance Mode:** A software toggle to allow for authorized access without triggering alarms.

## System Architecture

The system is built on a robust, two-part architecture: a dedicated **Embedded Node** for sensing and actuation, and a powerful **Gateway & Application Server** running on the Raspberry Pi. Communication between the two is handled by MQTT for lightweight messaging and a direct endpoint for image transfers.

```graphviz
digraph System_Architecture {
    rankdir=LR;
    graph [label="System Architecture & Data Flow", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=box, style=rounded, fontname="Arial"];
    edge [fontsize=10];

    subgraph cluster_hardware {
        label="On-Site Hardware (Server Room)";
        ESP32 [label="NodeMCU ESP32\n(Sensor & Actuator Controller)"];
        RPi [label="Raspberry Pi 5"];
        Webcam [label="Logitech C270 USB Webcam", shape=component];
    }

    subgraph cluster_cloud {
        label="Cloud Services";
        MQTT_Broker [label="MQTT Broker", shape=cylinder];
        Firebase [label="Firebase\n(DB & Storage)", shape=database];
    }
    
    // Connections

## Logical Flows

### 1. Climate Control Flow (Continuous Local Loop)

This logic runs entirely on the **NodeMCU ESP32** and does not require an internet connection to function.

```graphviz
digraph Climate_Control_Flow {
    graph [label="Climate Control Logic", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=box, style=rounded];
    
    Start [shape=ellipse, label="Loop Start"];
    ReadTemp [label="Read Temperature\nfrom DHT22"];
    MapSpeed [label="Map Temperature Range\n(e.g., 20-40Â°C)\nto Fan Speed Range\n(e.g., 40-100%)"];
    SetSpeed [label="Set Fan Speed\nvia PWM to L298N Driver"];
    Wait [shape=ellipse, label="Wait 5 seconds"];
    
    Start -> ReadTemp -> MapSpeed -> SetSpeed -> Wait -> Start;
}
```

### 2. Unauthorized Access Alert Flow (System-Wide Sequence)

This sequence involves communication between every part of the system.

```graphviz
digraph Alert_Sequence {
    graph [label="Unauthorized Access Logic Flow", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=box, style=rounded, fontname="Arial"];
    edge [fontsize=10];
    
    {rank=same; ESP32; RPi_Gateway; Firebase;}

    ESP32 -> RPi_Gateway [label="1. Door Opens.\nESP32 sends 'door_open' event (MQTT)."];
    RPi_Gateway -> Firebase [label="2. Pi receives event.\nChecks 'Maintenance Mode'\nin DB. It is OFF."];
    RPi_Gateway -> RPi_Gateway [label="3. Pi triggers C270 Webcam\nto capture an image."];
    RPi_Gateway -> ESP32 [label="4. Pi sends 'buzz_on'\ncommand back (MQTT)."];
    RPi_Gateway -> Firebase [label="5. Pi uploads image to Storage\n& writes CRITICAL log to DB\nwith the image URL."];
    
    subgraph {
        rank=same;
        ESP32 [label="ESP32 Node"];
        RPi_Gateway [label="Raspberry Pi Logic"];
        Firebase [label="Firebase DB & Storage"];
    }
}
```

## Firebase Data Model

Our cloud data is structured into two main parts: a log of all events and a single object representing the current system state.

```graphviz
digraph Data_Model {
    graph [label="Firebase Database Structure", labelloc=t, fontsize=16];
    node [shape=record, fontname="Arial"];
    
    Firebase_Root [label="<f0> Firebase Project | { <f1> event_logs (list) | <f2> system_status (object) }"];
    Event_Log_Entry [label="{ <id> -M_unique_id | { timestamp | event_type | alert_level | image_url? | temperature_C } }"];
    System_Status_Object [label="{ <f0> system_status | { is_maintenance_mode_on | is_door_open | last_command } }"];
    
    Firebase_Root:f1 -> Event_Log_Entry [label="contains multiple"];
    Firebase_Root:f2 -> System_Status_Object [label="is a single object"];
}
```
